# Touch & Performance Optimizer

A Node.js application that provides three optimization switches to enhance touch sensitivity, reduce input latency, and optimize FPS performance.

## Features

1. **Enhanced Touch Sensitivity**
   - Increases touch sensitivity and response rate by 10x
   - Makes touch interactions smoother and more responsive

2. **Zero Latency Mode**
   - Reduces input delay to the absolute minimum
   - Eliminates lag between touch input and on-screen response

3. **60 FPS Lock**
   - Locks frame rate to a smooth 60 FPS
   - Optimizes system performance
   - Clears caches and background processes
   - Improves overall system responsiveness

## Prerequisites

- Node.js (v14 or higher)
- npm (comes with Node.js)
- Administrator/root privileges (for some optimizations)

## Installation

1. Clone or download this repository
2. Navigate to the project directory:
   ```
   cd touch-optimization
   ```
3. Install dependencies:
   ```
   npm install
   ```

## Usage

1. Start the application:
   ```
   npm start
   ```
2. Open your web browser and navigate to:
   ```
   http://localhost:3000
   ```
3. Toggle the switches to enable/disable each optimization

## Notes

- Some optimizations may require administrator/root privileges to take full effect
- The application provides a web interface for easy control
- All settings are applied in real-time
